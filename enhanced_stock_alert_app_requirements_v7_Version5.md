# Enhanced Stock Alert App Requirements (v7) – Merged & Expanded

---

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Scoring System & Signal Generation

- **Multi-Factor Scoring:**  
  Each stock/option is scored using:
  - Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, Volume spikes, Bollinger Bands, ATR, CCI, etc.)
  - Fundamental analysis (EPS, P/E, revenue growth, analyst ratings, insider activity)
  - AI predictions (ML models for price forecasting, anomaly detection, pattern recognition)
  - News & Social Sentiment (NLP on news, social, SEC filings, event detection)
  - Options flow (strike, implied volatility, open interest, volume)
  - Institutional activity (large trades, ETF flows)

- **Weighted by Trading Style:**  
  Users select a style—Day, Swing, Long-Term—which sets score weights for each signal type:
  - **Day Trading:** Focus on patterns, anomalies, short-term indicators
  - **Swing Trading:** Technical + some fundamental, medium-term signals
  - **Long-Term Investing:** Fundamental + AI long-term prediction

- **Parameter Examples:**  
  - Golden Cross/Death Cross, EMA crossovers, candlestick patterns, volatility indexes (VIX), Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, Max Drawdown.

### 1.2 Alert Logic

- **Alert Center:**  
  - All triggered alerts appear in a central dashboard.
  - Alerts based on final score crossing dynamic thresholds (adaptive to volatility/risk).
  - Option to receive alerts via Email, SMS, in-app notification.

- **Types of Alerts:**  
  - Price/volume movement, technical pattern detected, sentiment shift, option flow, fundamental event.

- **Customizable:**  
  - Users can filter alert types, tune sensitivity, and select assets or sectors of interest.

### 1.3 Data Pipeline & AI

- **Multi-Source Aggregation:**  
  - Real-time and historical data from Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, SEC EDGAR, Finnhub, social feeds.
  - ML/AI engine (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, transformers, Prophet).

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Aggregate features for every asset for model input.

- **Model Ensemble:**  
  - Blend predictions from technical, fundamental, sentiment, and pattern models.
  - Continuous learning and retraining with new data and user feedback.

- **Explainability:**  
  - Show users why an alert triggered (feature importance, confidence score).

### 1.4 UI & Dashboard

- **Dashboard Features:**  
  - Market overview, sector heatmap, top AI recommendations.
  - Alert center, historical performance metrics, KPIs (Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, Drawdown, ROI).
  - Option trading panel, asset screener, backtesting results.

- **User Experience:**  
  - Responsive, modern interface (Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind).
  - Easy onboarding, settings, and personalization.

### 1.5 Advanced & Stretch Features

- **Alternative Data:**  
  - Google Trends, web traffic, ESG scores (if available).
- **Automated Backtesting:**  
  - Simulate strategies on historical data.
- **User Feedback Loop:**  
  - Users rate alerts, system adapts.
- **Security & Privacy:**  
  - E2E encryption, GDPR compliance, opt-in analytics.
- **Performance & Reliability:**  
  - >99.5% uptime, fast response, robust error handling.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Multi-language, WCAG guidelines (optional).

## 2. Summarized Functionality

### **How Does the App Work?**

1. **Data Aggregation:**  
   The app continuously collects market, news, sentiment, options, and fundamental data for thousands of assets.

2. **Signal Scoring:**  
   For each asset, technical, fundamental, AI, sentiment, and options signals are processed and scored based on the user’s trading style.

3. **Alert Generation:**  
   When a stock/option’s score, or specific technical/event trigger, crosses a dynamic threshold, an alert is generated.

4. **User Customization:**  
   Users can choose their trading style, filter assets/sectors, set alert sensitivity, and select notification preferences.

5. **AI/ML Enhancement:**  
   - Price prediction and anomaly detection via ML models.
   - Sentiment via NLP.
   - Pattern recognition via chart analysis.
   - Ensemble model blends all scores for accuracy.

6. **Dashboard & Alerts:**  
   - Users receive alerts on the dashboard (and optionally via email/SMS).
   - Dashboard displays market overview, asset screener, sector heatmap, top recommendations, and backtesting results.

7. **Performance Tracking:**  
   - Historical alert performance (Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, Drawdown, ROI).
   - Continuous backtesting and improvement.

8. **Advanced Features (Optional):**  
   - Alternative data, deeper ML personalization, automated trading integrations, accessibility features.
